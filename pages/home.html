      <h4>“WE’RE DEFINITELY CONTENDERS FOR THE BIG SPOTS IN THE TOURNAMENT”: HYLISSANG FEELS FNATIC WILL MAKE A DEEP RUN AFTER SURVIVING GROUP C</h4>
      <p>
        Incredibly, Fnatic pulled it off and made it out of the ‘group of death’ and head into the knockouts after a tense final day. Now, Hylissang thinks they’re capable of making a deep run.

        How good is Fnatic really? How good is Europe? These questions were raised often by fans and analysts during the first half of the Worlds Group Stage. On Saturday, however, Fnatic silenced those who doubted them by going 3-0 in one of the hardest groups of Worlds, ever, booking their place in the knockout stage of the World Championship, and joining the other two LEC teams in the process. Fnatic were truly online.

        After Fnatic’s insane run, taking down Clutch Gaming, SK Telecom T1 and Royal Never Give Up, Zdravets "Hylissang" Iliev Galabov opened up about the games, what’s next for the team, and how they feel heading into the knockout stages of the tournament.

        With a gruelling schedule ahead of them, Fnatic’s first game was not the kind of game that they hoped for. The 48-minute slugfest could have gone either way, and Hylissang admits that Clutch won the draft, saying, “I was last pick but I didn’t have any idea what I should play into their Heimerdinger and Gangplank. We had a dive composition and that diving into Heimerdinger turrets and a Gangplank ultimate doesn’t really work that well. I think they didn’t play their best game, so we somehow outfought them even though it was difficult.”
